# 🩺 Gupt Aarogya - Sexual Health Awareness Platform

**Gupt Aarogya** is our very first hackathon project built with a mission to **spread awareness on sexual health** in a safe, accessible, and user-friendly way. Designed and developed entirely using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (Frontend Only)**, the platform offers multilingual support, educational blogs, doctor-led courses, and appointment scheduling.

- ✅ Educational **blogs** on sexual health
- ✅ **Appointment booking** with medical professionals
- ✅ **Multilingual support** for inclusivity
- ✅ Curated **courses by certified doctors**
- ✅ A fully responsive, user-centric frontend interface
