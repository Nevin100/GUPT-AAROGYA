      <h2>WHAT IS SEXUAL HEALTH?</h2>
      <p>According to the World Health Organization, sexual health, when viewed affirmatively, requires a positive and respectful approach to sexuality and sexual relationships, as well as the possibility of having pleasurable and safe sexual experiences, free of coercion, discrimination and violence. A positive sexual experience is one that includes the most enjoyment for you and your partner while also reducing or eliminating any potential health risks through proper preparation and education.</p>
      <br>
      <h3>Good sexual health depends on a number of factors, including:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>An environment and a view of self that promotes positive and affirming views of sexuality.</li>
        <li>Access to factual, helpful and comprehensive information and resources about sexuality that leads to healthy behaviors</li>
        <li>Knowledge of the risks of unprotected sex and the actions you can take to make sexual activity as safe as possible.</li>        
        <li>Access to sexual health care.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>SEXUAL WELLNESS</h2>
      <p>There are a lot of wellness conditions that may impede your sex life, from erectile dysfunction to the presence of STDs like HIV/AIDS to reproductive tract infections (RTIs). Finding the right treatment for these conditions will help increase you and your partner’s mutual comfort and satisfaction with sex. Also, partners who experience pain, limited libido, chronic exhaustion and even mental/emotional health conditions may benefit from medical advice about when or whether sexual activity is healthy. With a doctor’s help, many of these conditions can be significantly alleviated, or even eliminated over time.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Treatment for sexual illnesses or dysfunctions may seem to be a difficult topic to address with your doctor, but it’s a necessary step to sexual wellness, and confidentiality is a key aspect of such conversations. Sexual health specialists, and even general practitioners, are typically experienced in fielding these types of conversations and care about your comfort. If you feel nervous addressing these questions, just know your feelings are valid, and a caring physician will do everything they can to make the conversation as easy as possible</p>
